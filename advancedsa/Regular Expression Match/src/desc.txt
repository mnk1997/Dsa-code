Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for ' ? ' and ' * ' for strings A and B.

' ? ' : Matches any single character.
' * ' : Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).



The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).


 A = "aaa"
 B = "a*"
 Since '*' matches any sequence of characters. Last two 'a' in string A will be match by '*'.
 So, the pattern matches we return 1.

A = "acz"
 B = "a?a"
'?' matches any single character. First two character in string A will be match.
 But the last character i.e 'z' != 'a'. Return 0.
