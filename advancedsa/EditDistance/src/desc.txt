Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of steps required to convert A to B. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

 A = "abad"
 B = "abac"
 A = "abad" and B = "abac"
 After applying operation: Replace d with c. We get A = B.


 A = "Anshuman"
 B = "Antihuman

 A = "Anshuman" and B = "Antihuman"
 After applying operations: Replace s with t and insert i before h. We get A = B.
