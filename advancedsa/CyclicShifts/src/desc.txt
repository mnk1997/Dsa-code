Given two binary strings A and B, count how many cyclic shift of B when taken XOR with A give 0.


NOTE: If there is a string, S0, S1, ... Sn-1 , then it is a cyclic shift is of the form Sk, Sk+1, ... Sn-1, S0, S1, ... Sk-1 where k can be any integer from 0 to N-1.


 A = "1001"
 B = "0011"
 4 cyclic shifts of B exists: "0011", "0110", "1100", "1001".
 There is only one cyclic shift of B i.e. "1001" which has 0 xor with A.

 A = "111"
  B = "111"
All cyclic shifts of B are same as A and give 0 when taken xor with A. So, the ans is 3.

Observation
      For equal length of A and B
    1. if they have combination of 0 and 1 only one xor is possible
    2. if only one binary is present then length of string

    //Wrong Observation as 1100 and 1010 can never be xor equal to 0

    // We have to check by anyhow instring b is there possiblity of the same pattern like in string A
